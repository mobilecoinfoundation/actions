  steps:
    - name: Install SGX SDK
      shell: bash
      # In order to propagate the environment variables to subsequent steps we
      # need to redirect through $GITHUB_ENV, see
      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable
      # We can't do `cat /opt/intel/sgxsdk/environment >> $GITHUB_ENV` because
      # the environment file has _logic_ which the `GITHUB_ENV` parser will
      # fail on.  So we manually pass on the known environment variables.
